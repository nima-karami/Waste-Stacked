## Abstract:
Construction and demolition activities generate approximately one billion tons of waste every year in the world. While the majority of these materials can be either reused or recycled, they are often disposed of in landfills which leads to long-term environmental issues. This thesis investigates the reuse of construction and demolition waste through robotic stacking of irregular components in compression-only structures. Previous works have emphasized the environmental and economic benefits of using as-found materials, however, the practicality of this strategy has remained low due to increased complexity of non-standard waste components and their assembly systems. This research attempts to tackle this issue by employing an adaptive and automated stacking workflow. A mechanism is designed with off-the-shelf technologies to enable a six-axis collaborative robot with perception, real-time physics simulation, and motion planning. Two compression-only structures, a column and a wall, are digitally prototyped to assess the efficiency and usability of the interface. Reclaiming waste materials through an adaptive fabrication process can benefit the construction industry by minimizing residue, reducing costs, and decreasing the environmental footprint of buildings. Moreover, this interface can be used to build durable disaster relief shelters and enable construction during expeditions to inaccessible locations.

## Relevance:
I pursued this topic as my Master's thesis for academic and personal reasons.
- Construction and demolition waste management is an issue that concerns many countries in the world. While the majority of C&D waste can be reused or recycled, they are often landfilled which has adverse environmental consequences. 
- While recycling is better than producing new materials, it might not be the best solution in some cases due to increased costs and carbon footprint.
- Reusing materials on-site minimizes the need for transportation and greatly reduces the carbon footprint and the cost of construction.

- Researching this topic allowed me to experiment with advanced digital fabrication technologies such an industrial robotic arm.
- This thesis could help me improve my programming skills and increase my knowledge of algorithms.
